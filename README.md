# Lab29 - RESTy - Advanced State with Reducers

## Description

RESTy Phase 4: Track History

### Phase 4 Requirements

In phase 4, we will be tracking every API call and storing it in history

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- *As a user, I want to see a list of my previous API calls, so that I can see the results again, quickly*

### Application Flow

- User enters an API URL
- Chooses a REST Method
- Clicks the “Go” button
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
- Application stores the API request and returned data into state
- Updates the list of previous API calls
- Application Displays the response headers and results separately
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON
